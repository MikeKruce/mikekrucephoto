                    <p>Growing up in the South Jersey / Philadelphia area, I took up photography as a hobby at the young age of 40, doing landscapes and wildlife. As the compliments grew on my photos, and I realized how much I enjoyed photography, I decided to expand into other fields. Starting by photographing some free concerts and little league games, I was able to get some attention by some local sites, to allow me to photograph some bigger venues. The more I photographed, the more I fell in love with it, and gained the attention of so many people, thanks to my work.</p>
                    <p>I specialize in Real Estate Photography. My real estate photos will help your listings come alive. Between the sky replacements, HDR Interiors, the property webpage I provide, Aerials, 360 Virtual Tours, easy online booking, and photos returned in less than 24hrs, I should be your 1st choice, to get your listings done, quickly, and right every time. Get the full package for less than some charge for just photos. There is a reason I have so many high reviews.</p>
                    <p>I am also a credentialed photographer shooting Sports and Concerts in the Philadelphia Region for various media outlets. My credentials include the Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia Soul and Atlantic City Blackjacks in the Arena Football League, The Philadelphia Union MLS team, Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs (Phillies Triple A Team), as well as shooting concerts in multiple casinos, and venues in the Philadelphia area.</p>
                    <p>Located in Somerdale NJ, I am your go-to photographer. I will travel where I am needed. Whether itâ€™s in South Jersey, Philadelphia, The Jersey Shore, or Delaware, I will work with you, in order to get the shots you need.</p>
